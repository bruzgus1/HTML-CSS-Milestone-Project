        <h2>Introduction To The Site</h2>
        <p id="paragrath">In this website we ranked the most popular anime ever made, voted in by the anime community on <a href="https://myanimelist.net/">MyAnimeList</a>, 
            you can find this list in the Official list section that has been categoriesed so you can pick based on the genre you enjoy the most, on top of that we created a Personal List
             with the anime that in our eyes does not get as much attention as it should. The Offial List was created just
            to share the results of the most highly regarded anime there are, but the Personal list is to give you something to watch that hopefully
            you haven't heard of before, and to those who are new to anime I incurage you to watch the video below as it is a mix of great anime moments.
            Thank you for using our site and enjoy
        </p>
