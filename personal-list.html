                <strong>Plot Summary:</strong> As the world is in the middle of an industrial revolution, a monster
                appears
                that cannot be defeated unless its heart, which is protected by a layer of iron, is pierced.
                By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as
                Kabane.
                On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves
                from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help
                of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and
                helps
                to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures.
                One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused
                from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikuma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro
                going
                out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack
                by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.
