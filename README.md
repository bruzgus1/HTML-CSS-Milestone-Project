# Most Popular Anime
This website is targeted for beginner or intermediate anime watchers,in hopes of providing  a category based list for the most popular and highly liked anime there is, the ranking is from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) the most known anime site in the world. There is also a section of my personal best anime where I made a category based list of under rated or less know but still very good and enjoyable anime shows, that even an experienced anime watcher might like and find something they haven't heard about. Each category has 10 listed anime by rank of enjoyment.
