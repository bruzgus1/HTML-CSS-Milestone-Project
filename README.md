# Project Goals
[View the live project here.](https://bruzgus1.github.io/HTML-CSS-Milestone-Project/index.html)

This website is intended for beginner or intermediate anime watchers, in hopes of providing a list for the most popular and highly liked anime there is, the ranking is from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) the most known anime site in the world. There is also a section of my personal best anime where I made a list of under rated or less know but still very good and enjoyable anime shows, that even an experienced anime watcher might like and find something they haven't heard about.

**User Goals:**

- To find the most popular anime in the world
- To find some other recommended anime


**Site Owner Goals:**
- To provide a list of the most popular anime in the world
