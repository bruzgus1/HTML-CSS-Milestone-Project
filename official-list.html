                <strong>Plot Summary:</strong> "In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost."
                Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers
                Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human
                transmutation.
                They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg,
                Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm
                that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone,
                it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies
                that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called "automail" and become a state alchemist,
                the Fullmetal Alchemist.

            seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived 
            by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants. 
            Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren 
            and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant 
            that appears out of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror 
            as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.
